Choose Your Own Adventure

Create a  application that allows users to play a text-based "choose your own adventure" style game. 
The game may be built around any theme you choose (ie: Surviving a zombie attack, successfully making it to a burrito food cart across town before it closes, 
getting to Epicodus on time in the morning, etc.)
Begin by presenting the user with a scenario (For instance: "You're walking along a path, when there's a fork in the road. You must choose to go either left or right. 
Which direction do you walk?"). Then, offer different subsequent scenarios depending on the user's response.
Repeat this process until you have many different gameplay possibilities and multiple potential endings. 
The user should have to make their way through many different decisions and scenarios, before they either win by reaching the game's goal 
(ie: Surviving that zombie attack, or making it to Epicodus before 8), or lose by not meeting that goal. Offer users the chance to start the game over when they lose.





Other Game

Created either a Pig Dice, Tic-Tac-Toe game or any other game you feel you would like to create.
Recreate one of these as a command line interface game in Java (consider tackling the project you didn't complete in Intro). 
Make sure to follow the "Red, Green, Refactor" BDD workflow throughout the course of development.
