	Expected Output:
		212.0 degree Fahrenheit is equal to 100.0 in Celsius
	  
Data2. Write a Java program that reads a number in inches, converts it to meters   

	Note: One inch is 0.0254 meter.
	
	Test Data
		Input a value for inch: 1000
	Expected Output :
		1000.0 inch is 25.4 meters
	  
Data3. Write a Java program that reads an integer between 0 and 1000 and adds all the digits in the integer.

	Test Data
		Input an integer between 0 and 1000: 565
	Expected Output:
		The sum of all digits in 565 is 16.

Data4. Write a Java program to convert minutes into a number of years and days.
  
	Test Data
		Input the number of minutes: 3456789
	Expected Output:
		3456789 minutes is approximately 6 years and 210 days

Data5. Write a Java program that prints the current time in GMT.

	Test Data
		Input the time zone offset to GMT: 256
	Expected Output:
		Current time is 23:40:24

Data6. Write a Java program to compute body mass index (BMI).

	Test Data
		Input weight in pounds: 452
		Input height in inches: 72
	Expected Output:
		Body Mass Index is 61.30159143458721

Data7. Write a Java program to takes the user for a distance 
	   (in meters) and the time was taken (as three numbers: 
 	   hours, minutes, seconds), and display the speed, in 
 	   meters per second, kilometers per hour and miles per 
 	   hour (hint: 1 mile = 1609 meters).

	Test Data
		Input distance in meters: 2500
		Input hour: 5
		Input minutes: 56
		Input seconds: 23
	Expected Output:
		Your speed in meters/second is 0.11691531
		Your speed in km/h is 0.42089513
		Your speed in miles/h is 0.26158804

Data 8. Write a Java program that reads a number and display the square, cube, and fourth power.

	Expected Output:
		Square: .2f 
		Cube: .2f
		Fourth power: 50625.00

Data9. Write a Java program that accepts two integers from the 
 	   user and then prints the sum, the difference, the product, 
	   the average, the distance (the difference between integer), 
 	   the maximum (the larger of the two integers), the minimum 
       (smaller of the two integers).

	Test Data
		Input 1st integer: 25 
		Input 2nd integer: 5
	Expected Output:
		Sum of two integers: 30
		Difference of two integers: 20
		Product of two integers: 125
		Average of two integers: 15.00
		Distance of two integers: 20
		Max integer: 25 
		Min integer: 5

Data10. Write a Java program to break an integer into a sequence of 
individual digits. 

	Test Data
		Input six non-negative digits: 123456
	Expected Output:
		1 2 3 4 5 6
