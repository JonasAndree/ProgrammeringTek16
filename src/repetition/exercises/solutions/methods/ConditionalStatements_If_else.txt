IfElse27. Write a Java program that reads an integer and check whether it is negative, zero, or positive.

	Test Data
		Input a number: 7 
	Expected Output :
	 	Number is positive

IfElse28. Write a Java program that reads a floating-point number. If the number is zero it prints "zero", 
	otherwise, print "positive" or "negative". Add "small" if the absolute value of the number is less than 1, 
	or "large" if it exceeds 1,000,000.

	Test Data
		Input a number: -2534 
	Expected Output :
	 	Negative

IfElse29. Write a Java program that reads an positive integer and count the number of digits the number (less than ten billion) has.

	Test Data
		Input an integer number less than ten billion: 125463
	Expected Output:
	 	Number of digits in the number: 6

IfElse30. Write a Java program that accepts three numbers and prints "All numbers are equal" if all three numbers are equal, 
	"All numbers are different" if all three numbers are different and "Neither all are equal or different" otherwise.

	Test Data
		Input first number: 2564
		Input second number: 3526 
		Input third number: 2456
	Expected Output:
		All numbers are different



IfElse31. Write a program that accepts three numbers from the user and prints "increasing" if the numbers are in increasing order, 
	"decreasing" if the numbers are in decreasing order, and "Neither increasing or decreasing order" otherwise.
	
	Test Data
		Input first number: 1524 
		Input second number: 2345
		Input third number: 3321
	Expected Output:
		Increasing order
	
IfElse32. Write a Java program that accepts two floating­point numbers and checks whether they are the same up to two decimal places. 	
	
	Test Data
		Input first floating­point number: 1235
		Input second floating­point number: 2534 
	Expected Output:
		These numbers are different.
